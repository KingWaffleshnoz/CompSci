### Jared's Repository for AP Computer Science A 2019-2020
Contained in this repo are all the files of code I turned into Canvas during my time in AP CS A at my high school. Due to the learning environment in which these files were created, the code is predominantly written for readability and comprehension over efficiency.

Note that all code was written to run specifically in [jGRASP v2.0.5](https://www.jgrasp.org/) using [JDK 12.0.2](https://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/12-0-2-relnotes-5480112.html), so some edits may need to be implemented in order to test any code in differing environments.
